for each chapter (that will be a folder) we need to have a explainer and example code snippets that actually work.

- The explaination should not be verbose, crisp and to the point no BS or beat around the bush
- The goal of the user is to learn the C lang as quickly as possible
- for each code make sure we have a code file ready , example if we have a sub chapter x.xx then makde sure to have a seperate folder of it and code and markdown should be inside it.
