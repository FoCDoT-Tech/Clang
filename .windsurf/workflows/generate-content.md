generate content for the folder (which is a chapter), the index is stored at @C_Language_Index.md always refer to it when generating contnet. the content must have explaination only in markdown and code examples which run and have proper comments.
always have explainers first then the code.

- The explaination should not be verbose, crisp and to the point no BS or beat around the bush
- The goal of the user is to learn the C lang as quickly as possible
- for each code make sure we have a code file ready , example if we have a sub chapter x.xx then makde sure to have a seperate folder of it and code and markdown should be inside it.
- if previos chapters are already present then while generating the new chapters make sure we are building on top of them.
- for each code inside the chapter make sure the markdown has reference of the the code and gives a one liner comand to run the code as well.
- before generating the content of a chapter always tell the user what you are generating , take approval and then go ahead (get the overview of the content approved)
