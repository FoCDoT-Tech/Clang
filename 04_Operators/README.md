# 4. Operators

Operators are symbols that perform operations on variables and values. C provides a rich set of operators for arithmetic, comparison, logical operations, and more.

## Chapter Overview

This chapter covers all C operators systematically:

- **4.1 Arithmetic Operators**: Basic math operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`)
- **4.2 Relational Operators**: Comparisons (`<`, `>`, `==`, `!=`)
- **4.3 Logical Operators**: Boolean logic (`&&`, `||`, `!`)
- **4.4 Bitwise Operators**: Bit-level operations (`&`, `|`, `^`, `~`, `<<`, `>>`)
- **4.5 Assignment Operators**: Value assignment (`=`, `+=`, `-=`, etc.)
- **4.6 Other Operators**: Special operators (`?:`, `sizeof`, `&`, `*`)
- **4.7 Operator Precedence**: Order of evaluation rules

## Learning Progression

Each section builds on previous knowledge:
- Uses data types from Chapter 3
- Demonstrates practical applications
- Shows common pitfalls and solutions
- Prepares for control flow (Chapter 5)

## Quick Reference

| Category | Operators | Purpose |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Arithmetic | `+ - * / %` | Math operations |
| Relational | `< > <= >= == !=` | Comparisons |
| Logical | `&& \|\| !` | Boolean logic |
| Bitwise | `& \| ^ ~ << >>` | Bit manipulation |
| Assignment | `= += -= *= /= %=` | Value assignment |
| Other | `?: sizeof & *` | Special operations |
