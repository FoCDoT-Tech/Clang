# 5. Control Flow

Control flow statements determine the order of execution in your program. They enable decision-making, repetition, and program flow control.

## Chapter Overview

This chapter covers all C control flow mechanisms:

- **5.1 Conditional Statements**: Decision-making with `if`, `else`, `switch`
- **5.2 Loops**: Repetition with `for`, `while`, `do-while`
- **5.3 Jump Statements**: Flow control with `break`, `continue`, `goto`, `return`

## Learning Progression

Each section builds on previous knowledge:
- Uses operators from Chapter 4 for conditions
- Demonstrates practical programming patterns
- Shows performance considerations
- Prepares for function design (Chapter 6)

## Quick Reference

| Category | Statements | Purpose |
|----------|------------|---------|
| Conditional | `if` `else` `switch` | Decision making |
| Loops | `for` `while` `do-while` | Repetition |
| Jump | `break` `continue` `goto` `return` | Flow control |
