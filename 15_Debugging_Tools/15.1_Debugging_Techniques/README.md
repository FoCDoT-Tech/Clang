# 15.1 Debugging Techniques

Essential debugging methods for finding and fixing C program issues.

## Key Techniques

### Printf Debugging
- Strategic print statements
- Debug macros and conditional compilation
- Tracing program flow
- Variable state inspection

### Debugger Usage (GDB)
- Setting breakpoints
- Stepping through code
- Examining variables and memory
- Stack trace analysis
- Core dump analysis

### Static Analysis
- Compiler warnings and errors
- Code analysis tools
- Lint utilities
- Memory checkers

### Systematic Debugging
- Reproduce the bug consistently
- Isolate the problem area
- Binary search debugging
- Rubber duck debugging

## Code Example

**Run:** `make run`

The demo shows practical debugging techniques with intentional bugs and their solutions.
