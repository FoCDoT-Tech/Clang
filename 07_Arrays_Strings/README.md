# Chapter 7: Arrays & Strings

Arrays and strings are fundamental data structures for storing collections of data. Arrays hold multiple elements of the same type, while strings are specialized arrays for text processing.

## Sections

- **7.1 Arrays** - One-dimensional arrays, declaration, initialization, operations
- **7.2 Multi-dimensional Arrays** - 2D arrays, matrices, memory layout, initialization
- **7.3 Strings** - Character arrays, string literals, null terminator, manipulation
- **7.4 String Functions** - Standard library functions, text processing, custom operations

## Quick Start

Build and run all array and string demos:
```bash
make run-all
```

Or run individual sections:
```bash
make run-arrays      # One-dimensional arrays
make run-multi       # Multi-dimensional arrays  
make run-strings     # String basics
make run-functions   # String functions
```
